	<h2>Background: Illustrative Pathways and Budget "Excess" ("overshoot")</h2>

	<ul>
	    <li>"Indicative Compliance Pathway" [ICP] denotes a "piecewise
	        linear" emissions pathway where the emissions level (tCO<sub>2</sub>e/s)
		declines linearly in time at just the right rate to exactly use
		up the approved budget within each successive 5-year period
		(starting with 2021-2025). The starting emissions level is
		calibrated on the basis that, if the pathway for 2021-2025 were
		extrapolated back for one year, the annual emissions level would
		match that of 2018 (nominal "pre-pandemic" level).</li>
	    <li>"Estimated Actual Pathway" [EAP] denotes an
		emissions pathway which is "piecewise linear" for
		each individual year at a time. The annual
		emissions level in each year matches the most
		recent EPA inventory where available, or
		otherwise the most recent EPA projections. For
		the first year (2021) the initial emissions level
		is interpolated as the mid-point between the
		annual inventory levels for 2020 and 2021. Within
		each year, the emissions level changes linearly
		to just match the required total annual
		emissions. The level at the end of each year then
		sets the initial level for the following year.
		left.</li>
	    <li>EAP is currently hardwired to follow the more optimistic EPA
	        projections, called "With Additional Measures" or WAM. However,
	        it would be better to also offer the option of using the more
	        realistic EPA "With Existing Measures" or WEM scenario (under
	        user control).</li>
	    <li>At any point in time, if the
		<em>cumulative</em> amount of the EAP is above that of the ICP this
		difference (ΣEAP - ΣICP) is interpreted as an emerging budget
		"excess", "overshoot" or "compliance gap". (Of course, if the
		cumulative EAP were to fall <em>below</em> the cumulative ICP
		this difference would be negative and indicate an emerging
		budget <em>surplus</em>: happy days!).</li>
	    <li>For the moment we are showing the excess denominated in
		tCO<sub>2</sub>e. It might equally (?)  be denominated in
		percent of the "available" budget to that time (i.e., ΣICP).</li>
	    <li>The gauge background uses a "traffic light" pattern: green is
	        "good" (definite compliance), red is "bad/stop" (definite
	        excess/overshoot), and then there is also an indicative area of orange in
	        between, denoting "uncertain" compliance status. The size of the
	        orange area is arbitrary, or rather relects a value judgement about the
	        reasonable space for ongoing policy "flexibility". But the
	        concepual intention is that going beyond orange, into red, should
	        unambiguously indicate a need for emergency policy action.</li>
	    <li>So on top of the traffic light background we present an indicator bar (purple)
		showing the current compliance status. If the indicator bar is
		centred/invisible ("12 o'clock", or 0 tCO<sub>2</sub>e or 0% of the budget) then
		we are running exactly as per the "Indicative Compliance"
		pathway. If this bar extends into the area to the right (orange-to-red)
		then this indicates an excess/overshoot and a compliance gap is
		opening up. Conversely, moving into the left area (orange-to-green) would
		indicate a (prudential!) "compliance surplus" being built up.</li>
	    <li>The "full scale" amount is a again fairly arbitrary, but
		would be informed by the projected maximum overshoot for
		some point into the future. </li>
	    <li>A separate or additional concept might be a gauge chart
		showing not the accumulative compliance gap but
		the <em>rate</em> at which that gap is increasing (or
		decreasing): i.e. are we still accelerating (relative to
		the "speed" that would comply with the budget) or are we at
		least beginning to apply the brakes?</li>
	</ul>
