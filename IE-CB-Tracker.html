	<h2>Concept: Illustrative Pathways and Compliance Gap</h2>

	<ul>
	    <li>"Indicative Compliance Pathway" [ICP] denotes an emissions
		pathway where the emissions level (tCO2e/s) declines linearly
		in time at just the right rate to exactly use up the approved
		budget over the full period 2021-2025. The starting emissions
		level is calibrated on the basis that, if the same pathway
		were extrapolated back for one year, the annual emissions
		level would match that of 2018 (nominal "pre-pandemic"
		level).</li>
	    <li>"Estimated Actual Pathway" [EAP] denotes an
		emissions pathway which is "piecewise linear" for
		each year of the budget period. The annual
		emissions level in each year matches the most
		recent EPA inventory where available, or
		otherwise the most recent EPA projections. For
		the first year (2021) the initial emissions level
		is interpolated as the mid-point between the
		annual inventory levels for 2020 and 2021. Within
		each year, the emissions level changes linearly
		to just match the required total annual
		emissions. The level at the end of each year then
		sets the initial level for the following year.
		left.</li>
	    <li>At any point in time during the budget period, if the
		cumulative amount of the EAP is above that of the ICP this
		difference (ΣEAP - ΣICP) is interpreted as an emerging budget
		excess or <em>Compliance Gap</em>. (Of course, if the
		cumulative EAP were to fall <em>below</em> the cumulative ICP
		this different would be negative and indicate an emerging
		budget <em>surplus</em>: happy days!).</li>
	    <li>For the moment we are showing the Compliance Gap denominated in
		tCO<sub>2</sub>e. It might equally (?)  be denominated in
		percent of the available budget.</li>

	    <li>The idea of the [imagined - not yet implemented!]
		"gauge" chart is that if the pointer is centred
		("12 o'clock", or 0 tCO<sub>2</sub>e or 0% of the budget)
		then we are running exactly as per the "Indicative
		Compliance" pathway. If it moves into the area to the right
		(to be coloured red?) then a compliance gap is opening
		up. Conversely, moving into the left area (to be coloured
		green?) would indicate a (prudential!) "compliance surplus"
		being built up.</li>
	    <li>The "full scale" amount is a bit arbitrary, but
		would be informed by the projected maximum overshoot for
		the full period. Thus, the full gauge
		might run from, say, -20% to +20% for CB1. </li>
	    <li>A separate or additional concept might be a gauge chart
		showing not the accumulative compliance gap but
		the <em>rate</em> at which that gap is increasing (or
		decreasing): i.e. are we still accelerating (relative to
		the "speed" that would comply with the budget) or are we at
		least beginning to apply the brakes?
